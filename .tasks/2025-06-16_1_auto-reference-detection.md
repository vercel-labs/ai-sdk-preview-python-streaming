# Task Description

Introduce automatic reference object detection so clients no longer need to
specify `reference_object` and `measurement_type` on photo upload.

# Project Overview

FastAPI service for photo measurement. We updated models, routers, and services
to auto-detect reference object.

# Analysis

Planned code changes to image_processor (add detect_best_reference_object),
models (nullable fields + optional), routers (fields optional), measurement
processing (auto-detect when missing).

# Proposed Solution

Implemented plan accordingly.

# Current execution step: "EXECUTE"

# Task Progress
